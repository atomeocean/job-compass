# 亚马逊 Amazon Inc.

总部位于美国西雅图。

## 工作环境
亚马逊是一个规模非常庞大的公司，其中AWS部门是它的核心部门。

中国留学生普遍在亚马逊的技术相关部门工作，因此不讨论亚马逊的仓库管理、物流等非技术部门，尽管这些部门以rapper多，工作时长过长著称。
类似的，亚马逊的技术部门也是血汗工厂，工作强度大，加班多，压力大。部门负责的业务越成熟，接的需求就越符合拧螺丝钉，不仅耗费精力，还没有成就感。这里面最恶心的部门当属AWS EC2部门，不要去。

多个信息来源爆出亚马逊利用规则克扣员工的交通补贴，导致纽约办公室员工每个月会少拿到约500
美元的交通补贴。这种做法引起了员工的不满，但由于亚马逊将这部分外包给第三方公司运营，并定义为“公司福利”。导致亚马逊公司不处理也不承担责任，外包公司趁机狐假虎威，将客服联系难度设置为阿富汗打卡级别，导致员工无法维权。

Hello *,

Thank you for your interest in Amazon’s Software Development Engineering full-time opportunities! The next part in your application process it to complete Part 2 of the Online Assessment. Below is key information that you will need to take Part 2 of the Online Assessment. Please read this entire email (including the FAQs at the end) before you start the assessment and keep a copy of this email for your reference. When you are ready to begin, set aside a block of 110 minutes of uninterrupted time to complete the assessment. Once you complete Part 2, you will receive an email with next steps.


What is included in Part 2: SDE Work Simulation and Workstyles Assessments?

At Amazon, it’s important that SDEs demonstrate both technical skills and our Leadership Principles. Part 2 of the Online Assessment includes SDE Work Simulation and Workstyles Assessment. The SDE Work Simulation is an interactive simulation designed to give you a window into a typical day in the life of an SDE at Amazon. During the simulation, you will be prompted with emails, videos, and instant messages from your virtual managers and team members to solve various problems. For each scenario, you will be provided with four to five viable options of how to respond and be asked to either rate the effectiveness of each response or select the single response that you think is the best course of action. Additional work materials will also be provided to help you make your decision, such as internal wikis, code snippets, and roadmaps. Next, you will complete the Workstyles Assessment which is built around Amazon’s Leadership Principles and asks you to choose statements that represent your work style. The Workstyles Assessment takes 10-20 minutes to complete.


How to prepare for Part 2: SDE Work Simulation and Workstyles Assessments:

1. Ensure that you are taking the Online Assessment on a laptop or desktop computer that meets the following requirements:
  * Internet browser: Google Chrome version 10+, Mozilla Firefox version 31+, Internet Explorer version 10+, Microsoft Edge version 18+, or Safari version 10+.
  * Bandwidth: At least 5 Mbps or the videos will be slow when loading.
  * Enable the following on your computer: Active Scripting (JavaScript), Session Cookies, CSS, AJAX.
  * Webcam: A webcam is required at the start of the code debugging test. You will use the webcam to take a picture of yourself during the session. You can test your webcam here.
  * Minimum screen resolution: 1024 x 768.
  * We do not recommend mobile devices or tablets due to limited functionality and user-interface experience.
  * Please ensure you have a reliable Internet connection when completing the assessment.

2. Other tips and advice for taking Part 2: SDE Work Simulation and Workstyles Assessments:
  * The assessment should take you roughly 90 minutes to complete. When you are ready to begin, please set aside at least 90 minutes of uninterrupted time.
  * Do not leverage the print screen functionality as your session will be terminated, and you will be locked out.


Technical Issues?

* If those do not work, please examine closely where you left off, log out, and log back in using the same Online Assessment link you used for starting the test. Do not repeatedly refresh the screen.
* If the Online Assessment link is redirecting you to a login page, we suggest you double-check that both pop-up blocker and ad-blocker has been disabled on your browser.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

Q: How can I prepare Part 2: SDE Work Simulation?

A: Brush up on C, C++, Python and Java coding skills before starting the work simulation. Additionally, setting aside an appropriate amount of time and finding a quiet location will be important. Don’t forget a strong Internet connection is also key!

Q: What happens after I complete part two of the assessment?

A: Once you complete the second part of the assessment, we will review and score the work. You will receive an email with next steps based upon the results.

Q: Why does the Online Assessment have two parts? Why can’t I do all parts in one sitting?

A: The Online Assessment evaluates coding skills, technical problem solving, and Amazon’s Leadership Principles. In order to cover all of those components, there are two parts to the assessment totaling approximately three to four hours of time. We have found that breaking the Online Assessment into pieces makes it easier for students to schedule and complete all assessment components.

Q: If I lose my internet connection in the middle of taking on of the two parts of the Online Assessment, will I be able to start where I left off, or will I start over?

A: If your connection is interrupted, you will be able to resume where you left off in the assessment. Log off and click the assessment link to resume.

Q: I cannot complete the Online Assessment within the number of days allocated. May I request an extension?

A: Yes; however, Amazon hires on a rolling basis and a delay in completing the Online Assessment may impact your candidacy. If you require an extension, please email sp-sde-fulltime-assessment@amazon.com, and our team will follow up within three business days of your email.
