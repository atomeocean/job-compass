With access to millions of miles of proprietary data and a mission to scale 1,000,000s of deliveries, your work will lay the foundation for Coco\u2019s success for years to come.\n\nWhat makes this role unique?\n\nYou\u2019ll build backend services that make automated decisions based on user behaviors, communicate with devices, and track information.\n\nYou'll partner with other Coco teams (e.g., Merchant Operations, Consumer Experience, Autonomy, and more), acting as a thought partner to tackle some of Coco\u2019s most pressing efficiency and profitability initiatives.\nYou\u2019ll lead with impact, not just building systems but setting the tone for the Platform Delivery team that we\u2019re growing.\n\nYour experience at Waymo in building complex mapping tools makes you well-suited to tackle the challenges of our Platform Delivery team. It would make you an incredible fit for this opportunity.\n\nIf shaping the future of urban logistics and building something very complex from scratch resonates with you, let\u2019s connect. I\u2019d love to share more about what we\u2019re building at Coco and explore how your vision and expertise can help lead us into the future.\n\nAre you interested in finding a time to speak this week? If so, please feel free to book some time with me here.\n\nBest regards,\nAlex\nCoco Robotics"
